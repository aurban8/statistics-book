# Student Learning Objectives   {#element-141}

* The student will design and carry out a survey.
* The student will analyze and graphically display the results of the survey.

# Instructions   {#element-782}

As you complete each task below, check it off. Answer all questions in your summary. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\_\_\_\_ Decide what data you are going to study. <div data-type="note" id="eip-idm151881920" data-label="Examples" markdown="1">
Here are two examples, but you may **NOT** use them: number of M&amp;M\'s per bag, number of pencils students have in their backpacks.

</div>

* * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\_\_\_\_ Are your data discrete or continuous? How do you know? * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\_\_\_\_ Decide how you are going to collect the data (for instance, buy 30 bags of M&amp;M\'s; collect data from the World Wide Web). * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\_\_\_\_ Describe your sampling technique in detail. Use cluster, stratified, systematic, or simple random (using a random number generator) sampling. Do not use convenience sampling. Which method did you use? Why did you pick that method? * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\_\_\_\_ Conduct your survey. **Your data size must be at least 30.** * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\_\_\_\_ Summarize your data in a chart with columns showing **data value, frequency, relative frequency and cumulative relative frequency.** * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

Answer the following (rounded to two decimal places): <span data-type="list" data-list-type="enumerated" id="eip-idm192589760" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <span data-type="item"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mover accent="true"> <mi>x</mi> <mo>Â¯</mo> </mover> </math>
 = \_\_\_\_\_</span> <span data-type="item">*s* = \_\_\_\_\_</span> <span data-type="item">First quartile = \_\_\_\_\_</span> <span data-type="item">Median = \_\_\_\_\_</span> <span data-type="item">70<sup>th</sup> percentile = \_\_\_\_\_</span> </span> \_\_\_\_ What value is two standard deviations above the mean?

\_\_\_\_ What value is 1.5 standard deviations below the mean? * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\_\_\_\_ Construct a histogram displaying your data. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\_\_\_\_ In complete sentences, describe the shape of your graph. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\_\_\_\_ Do you notice any potential outliers? If so, what values are they? Show your work in how you used the potential outlier formula to determine whether or not the values might be outliers. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\_\_\_\_ Construct a box plot displaying your data. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\_\_\_\_ Does the middle 50% of the data appear to be concentrated together or spread apart? Explain how you determined this. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\_\_\_\_ Looking at both the histogram and the box plot, discuss the distribution of your data.

# Assignment Checklist   {#element-175}

You need to turn in the following typed and stapled packet, with pages in the following order:

* {: data-label="____"} **Cover sheet**\: name, class time, and name of your study
* {: data-label="____"} **Summary page**\: This should contain paragraphs written with complete sentences. It should include answers to all the questions above. It should also include statements describing the population under study, the sample, a parameter or parameters being studied, and the statistic or statistics produced.
* {: data-label="____"} **URL** for data, if your data are from the World Wide Web
* {: data-label="____"} **Chart of data, frequency, relative frequency, and cumulative relative frequency**
* {: data-label="____"} **Page(s) of graphs:** histogram and box plot
{: data-labeled-item="true" data-mark-suffix=""}
