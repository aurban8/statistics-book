| When the English says: | Interpret this as: |
|----------
| *X* is at least 4. | *X* ≥ 4 |
| The minimum of *X* is 4. | *X* ≥ 4 |
| *X* is no less than 4. | *X* ≥ 4 |
| *X* is greater than or equal to 4. | *X* ≥ 4 |
| *X* is at most 4. | *X* ≤ 4 |
| The maximum of *X* is 4. | *X* ≤ 4 |
| *X* is no more than 4. | *X* ≤ 4 |
| *X* is less than or equal to 4. | *X* ≤ 4 |
| *X* does not exceed 4. | *X* ≤ 4 |
| *X* is greater than 4. | *X* &gt; 4 |
| *X* is more than 4. | *X* &gt; 4 |
| *X* exceeds 4. | *X* &gt; 4 |
| *X* is less than 4. | *X* &lt; 4 |
| There are fewer *X* than 4. | *X* &lt; 4 |
