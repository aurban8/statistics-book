# Student Learning Objectives   {#element-564}

* The students will collect a bivariate data sample through the use of appropriate sampling techniques.
* The student will attempt to fit the data to a linear model.
* The student will determine the appropriateness of linear fit of the model.
* The student will analyze and graph univariate data.

# Instructions   {#element-765}

1.  As you complete each task below, check it off. Answer all questions in your introduction or summary.
2.  Check your course calendar for intermediate and final due dates.
3.  Graphs may be constructed by hand or by computer, unless your instructor informs you otherwise. All graphs must be neat and accurate.
4.  All other responses must be done on the computer.
5.  Neatness and quality of explanations are used to determine your final grade.

# Part I: Bivariate Data   {#element-108}

<span data-type="title">Introduction</span>\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_State the bivariate data your group is going to study. <div data-type="note" id="eip-idp126031264" data-label="Examples" markdown="1">
Here are two examples, but you may **NOT** use them: height vs. weight and age vs. running distance.

</div>

* * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Describe your sampling technique in detail. Use cluster, stratified, systematic, or simple random sampling (using a random number generator) sampling. Convenience sampling is **NOT** acceptable. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Conduct your survey. Your number of pairs must be at least 30. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Print out a copy of your data.

<span data-type="title">Analysis</span> \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_On a separate sheet of paper construct a scatter plot of the data. Label and scale both axes. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_State the least squares line and the correlation coefficient. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_On your scatter plot, in a different color, construct the least squares line. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Is the correlation coefficient significant? Explain and show how you determined this. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Interpret the slope of the linear regression line in the context of the data in your project. Relate the explanation to your data, and quantify what the slope tells you. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Does the regression line seem to fit the data? Why or why not? If the data does not seem to be linear, explain if any other model seems to fit the data better. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Are there any outliers? If so, what are they? Show your work in how you used the potential outlier formula in the Linear Regression and Correlation chapter (since you have bivariate data) to determine whether or not any pairs might be outliers.

# Part II: Univariate Data   {#element-645}

In this section, you will use the data for **ONE** variable only. Pick the variable that is more interesting to analyze. For example: if your independent variable is sequential data such as year with 30 years and one piece of data per year, your *x*-values might be 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, …, 2000. This would not be interesting to analyze. In that case, choose to use the dependent variable to analyze for this part of the project. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Summarize your data in a chart with columns showing data value, frequency, relative frequency, and cumulative relative frequency. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Answer the following question, rounded to two decimal places: <span data-type="list" data-list-type="enumerated" id="eip-idp79349232" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <span data-type="item">Sample mean = \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_</span> <span data-type="item">Sample standard deviation = \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_</span> <span data-type="item">First quartile = \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_</span> <span data-type="item">Third quartile = \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_</span> <span data-type="item">Median = \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_</span> <span data-type="item">70th percentile = \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_</span> <span data-type="item">Value that is 2 standard deviations above the mean = \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_</span> <span data-type="item">Value that is 1.5 standard deviations below the mean = \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_</span> </span> \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Construct a histogram displaying your data. Group your data into six to ten intervals of equal width. Pick regularly spaced intervals that make sense in relation to your data. For example, do NOT group data by age as 20-26,27-33,34-40,41-47,48-54,55-61 . . . Instead, maybe use age groups 19.5-24.5, 24.5-29.5, . . . or 19.5-29.5, 29.5-39.5, 39.5-49.5, . . . * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_In complete sentences, describe the shape of your histogram. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Are there any potential outliers? Which values are they? Show your work and calculations as to how you used the potential outlier formula in [Descriptive Statistics](/m46925) (since you are now using univariate data) to determine which values might be outliers. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Construct a box plot of your data. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Does the middle 50% of your data appear to be concentrated together or spread out? Explain how you determined this. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Looking at both the histogram AND the box plot, discuss the distribution of your data. For example: how does the spread of the middle 50% of your data compare to the spread of the rest of the data represented in the box plot; how does this correspond to your description of the shape of the histogram; how does the graphical display show any outliers you may have found; does the histogram show any gaps in the data that are not visible in the box plot; are there any interesting features of your data that you should point out.
