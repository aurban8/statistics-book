*Use the following information to answer the next three exercises:* Suppose that a sample of 15 randomly chosen people were put on a special weight loss diet. The amount of weight lost, in pounds, follows an unknown distribution with mean equal to 12 pounds and standard deviation equal to three pounds. Assume that the distribution for the weight loss is normal.

<div data-type="exercise">
<div data-type="problem" markdown="1">
To find the probability that the mean amount of weight lost by 15 people is no more than 14 pounds, the random variable should be:

1.  number of people who lost weight on the special weight loss diet.
2.  the number of people who were on the diet.
3.  the mean amount of weight lost by 15 people on the special weight loss diet.
4.  the total amount of weight lost by 15 people on the special weight loss diet.

Compare the standard normal distribution to the Student’s *t*-distribution, centered at zero. Explain which of the following are true and which are false.

1.  As the number surveyed increases, the area to the left of –1 for the Student’s *t*-distribution approaches the area for the standard normal distribution.
2.  As the degrees of freedom decrease, the graph of the Student’s *t*-distribution looks more like the graph of the standard normal distribution.
3.  If the number surveyed is 15, the normal distribution should never be used.
